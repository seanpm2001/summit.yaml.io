====================

# Using this CogWeb Wiki

* This is a CogWeb wiki. The CogWeb software is included in this repository.
  * To enable the CogWeb software, run this command:
    `make && source .cogweb/.rc`
* The wiki pages are written in markdown and stored in the `.cog/` directory.
  * They have human friendly symlinks in the top level.
* The wiki website is generated by `cogweb` into the `.site/` directory.
  * It is then pushed to and served from GitHub Pages.
* Don't commit changes to git by hand.
  * Use the `cogweb` CLI described below.

# The `cogweb` Commands

* `cogweb new`

  Create a new page. The page should start with a title as the first line:

    ```# Page Title```

* `cogweb edit <page-name-or-id>`

  Edit an existing page. Use this instead of just using your editor. It
  validates, links and commits your changes in the appropriate manner.

* `cogweb build`

  Build the website from the current pages into the `.site/` directory.

* `cogweb test`

  Start a local server to test your changes before pushing.

* `cogweb push`

  Publish the wiki. Pushes to the `.site/` directory to the `gh-pages` branch
  (GitHub Pages). This does not push your wiki changes to the `master` branch.
  Use `git push` to do that.
